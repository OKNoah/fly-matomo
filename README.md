# Matomo for fly.io edge apps

The [official Matomo](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo-nodejs-tracker) npm package didn't work for me, so I'm rewriting it to work in fly.io's [CDN](https://fly.io/articles/fly-edge-applications-global-javascript/) that you can program in Javascript.

Doesn't work for you? Let me know. I'm very tired. It barely works for me, there's not tests, god be with you.
